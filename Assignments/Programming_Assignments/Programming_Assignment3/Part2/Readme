Command to Execute and run the encryption is as follows:
For Execution: “g++ project2_encryption.cpp -o out1”.
For Running: “./out1 symm_key.bin pubkey.pem privatekey.pem”.

And the output will be as follows:
*** WARNING : deprecated key derivation used.
Using -iter or -pbkdf2 would be better.
Enter pass phrase for privatekey.pem:

The pass phrase I used for the privatekey.pem is “14789”.
Therefore, the following files have been generated after running the encryption program, 
symmetric.txt, encrypt.txt, signed.txt.sha256.



Command to Execute and run the decryption is as follows:
For Execution: “g++ project2_decryption.cpp -o out2”.
For Running: “./out2 signed.txt.sha256 publickey.pem symmetric.txt”

And the output will be as follows:
Verified OK
*** WARNING : deprecated key derivation used.
Using -iter or -pbkdf2 would be better.
